# CharactersAPI
A library for [Figura](https://github.com/Kingdom-of-The-Moon/FiguraRewriteRewrite/tree/1.19.3) to initialize, edit, and switch between different characters created by the user.

Also requires a minified version of a [Lua Json library](https://github.com/rxi/json.lua) for character names

Feel free to pull request if there's code you don't like or something you want to add, or maintain your own fork if I'm inactive or something!
